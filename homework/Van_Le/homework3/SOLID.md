# SOLID

## What is SOLID principles?
SOLID principles are the design principles allowing us to manage and control almost problems of the software design. They are a set of best practices that also helps developers to code and test much easier and more effective. Therefore, when the scale of the application grows bigger and bigger, SOLID can help you to easily maitain the app.
Let's have a look at each principle one by one. SOLID is the acronym of:
- The Single Responsibility Principle
- The Open-Closed Principle
- The Liskov Substitution Principle
- The Interface Segregation Principle
- The Dependency Inversion Principle

### The Single Responsibility Principle
> A class should have one reason to change.
It says "Every software module should have only one reason to change". What does this mean? This means every class in your code should have only one job to do. Everything in that class should be related to a single purpose.
